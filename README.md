## Description
* Computer course assignment during high school.
* Old technology stack: **FrontPage**.
    * Limited to the time and technology at that time, the effect may be unsatisfactory
    * But in terms of ideas, there are bi-directional links, puzzle solving/decryption, modifying game files, space exploration, hand-picked background music, etc. All of this constitutes the exploration, shouting, and wandering of that personal period.

## Inplementation
1. When「Eimulator」or「Game Webpage」is turned on, click the Auxiliary's「Start」button
    * Ensure that there is no obstruction in the middle of the screen, which is directly the「Eimulator」or「Game Webpage」
        * The auxiliary will check the window
2. After starting the assistance, the「instruction manual」will pop up
    * Press the Tab key to「open or close」the instruction manual
    * To use the auxiliary, follow the button sequence instructions in the manual
